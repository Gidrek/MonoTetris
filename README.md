# MonoTetris

A simple Tetris game clone based in Microsoft XNA Examples.

Created with [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/) and .net core 3.1.

I used the `mgdesktopgl` template to generate the code.

It is a great project to learn and improve.

You can, add sounds, better graphics, a menu or a record table.
